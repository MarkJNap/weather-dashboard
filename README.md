# Weather Dashboard

## Description

With creating this weather dashboard I used information gathered from third party api's to create a Weather app of my own. Using both day.js and OpenWeather. I took the challenge to also learn Bulma as I am using it in another project. I sadly did not get to a satisfactory point of completion for this challenge and will continue to work on it to do better this was a great learning experience for me. 

## Installation

No installation steps needed

## Usage

To use this app the user simply needs to search for a city they wish to know the weather of and it will display the current time and the 5 day forecast ahead.
